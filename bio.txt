Go back to Heathers video and write a few notes about what to put in my bio here: 

1.) Identify your audience 
2.) Powerful first sentence: Who you are, what your audience can expect from you, how you are going to help them
3.) Tell a compelling story: about accomplishments, what makes you different/unique
4.) Create a call to action: to learn more abt you, share website
5.) Show some personality: help them relate to you
